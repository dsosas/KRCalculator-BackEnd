# Basic info

This project runs with Ruby 2.3.3 and Rails 5.1.4. It was created using only the necessary
elements for creating a few enpoints for the Client app to communicate via HTTP. Please clone
repository and run 'bundle install' inside the project directory. Then run 'rails s' so it starts
listening in port 3000. The front-end part of this project is already configured to make requests
at localhost:3000.
